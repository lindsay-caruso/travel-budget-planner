**Instructions**

1. Start by adding a new page to the [**Destination/Trip database**](Travel%20Budget%20Planner%20(1)%201a485936ac6e80dcbfaeef4532805e3f/goals%201a485936ac6e8129bbaef8a7c8eae4df.md)
    1. Add a picture to the page cover
    2. Donâ€™t worry about adding Estimated Cost or Amount Saved, thatâ€™s calculated automatically
2. If you already know any expenses youâ€™ll have on a trip, add them to the [**Expenses Database**](Travel%20Budget%20Planner%20(1)%201a485936ac6e80dcbfaeef4532805e3f.md)
    1. Choose a Spending Category, if your expense doesnâ€™t fit any of the premade ones you can always create a new one
    2. Then add the Estimated Cost, if you want to change the currency click on **Edit Property** and then on **Number Format** and pick one that fits you :)
    3. Next pick what trip the cost belongs to
3. If you already have any savings add them to the [**Savings Database**](Travel%20Budget%20Planner%20(1)%201a485936ac6e80dcbfaeef4532805e3f.md)
    1. Add Amount Saved, if you want to change the currency click on **Edit Property** and then on **Number Format** and pick one that fits you :)
    2. Next pick what trip the cost belongs to
4. Finish by deleting this Callout and the sample data
